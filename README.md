# Classification Task for the Adult Income Dataset Using Jupyter Notebook
This is a classification task of the adult income dataset using Random forest and Decision tree classification Alglorithm
Using the "Adult Income dataset, a machine learning task was performed in Python. The dataset comprises 14 features and includes categorical and numerical attributes. I used the Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms to train the models for classification tasks. The Random Forest model is recommended for deployment due to its higher accuracy (0.86) compared to the Decision Tree model (0.82).The Decision Tree and Random Forest confusion matrices reveal model performance. For the Decision Tree, 6566 instances were correctly predicted as class 0 (TN), 913 were false positives (FP), 802 were false negatives (FN), and 211488 were true positives (TP). The Random Forest exhibited better performance with 6936 TN, 543 FP, 826 FN, and1464 TP. These matrices aid in evaluating correct and erroneous predictions. The Random Forest outperforms the Decision Tree, showing higher correct predictions and lower misclassifications.
